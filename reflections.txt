# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
Ans: I chose terminal-table as my 3rd Gem.
As described in the site :
"Terminal Table is a fast and simple, yet feature rich ASCII table generator written in Ruby."
I looked at the readme document(examples) from github for this Gem, and created a nicer formatted output with table.
Tried to make use of the exposed methods of this class and understand how I should use them in my code.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Creating a new item type
	 Created another game item type which inherits from LinkItem.
	 Main prupose:
		- I wanted games related stuff which can be tied to website but not part of a generic LinkItem
		- I wanted to test how inheritance works as it seems like there is not much excercise coverage in the 
		  projects so far regarding inheritance. 
		  And its a good learning experience I must say.
		  
  b) Allow deletion of multiple items
	Added a new method which delete multiple items in the array by passing in an array of indexes in the method "delete_many"
	Made use of a new thing found which I can actually subtract arrays from one another
